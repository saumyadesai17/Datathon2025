# RetailAI

RetailAI is an AI-powered retail analytics platform that provides valuable insights into outlet sales, performance, demand forecasting, and expansion strategies. The system integrates sales analytics, predictive modeling, and competitor analysis to help businesses optimize their retail locations and marketing strategies.

Additionally, we have developed a React Native app that enables users to view food items, perform CRUD operations with order details, and receive personalized product recommendations based on user activity. The web platform is primarily for outlet authorities to monitor performance and manage outlet strategies.

## üöÄ Deployment

The RetailAI project is deployed and fully operational.

The entire project (frontend + backend) is deployed and accessible at [retailai.vercel.app](https://retailai.vercel.app/). The frontend is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), and the backend is hosted on [Render](https://render.com).

Please note that since both frontend and backend are hosted on free-tier services, there may be occasional delays in response time or website functionality due to the limitations of these services. This may be more noticeable during peak usage times.

Both services offer scalable solutions, and upgrading to paid plans can ensure improved performance and reliability.
